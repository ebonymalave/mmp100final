        Description (200 words giving the person listening to your work insight
        into your creative and technical process. For example: What was the
        artistic inspiration for this project? How did you make it your own?
        What format did you choose to make it in (music video, animation short,
        pseudo documentary)? What is your video about? What media techniques
        did you use? How did it change from your Storyboard conception to
        finish?

    - My primary inspiration for this project was based off an initial
    character design I had for a personal character of mine that eventually the
    character grew out of. I was still, very fond of the “mad scientist”
    concept, so I decided to revive the original concept again, this time
    giving it a more “Victorian Sci fi” element to it. The original inspiration
    for this concept was from my initial reading of Mary Shelley’s
    “Frankenstein”. I think I made it more of my own stylistically, there are
    elements I feel I included based off my own personal tastes that wouldn’t
    necessarily fit exactly with the concept, but I tried my best to do so. I
    chose to go with an animated short revealing the consequences of Hazel’s
    hyper fixation with experimenting, never really learning that her curiosity
    ventures too far and the overall affect it has on her both mentally and
    physically. With Hazel’s animation I wanted to capture her overall erratic
    nature and how fleeting her mind can be. As with the storyboard, I don’t
    think much changed although I chose to emphasize the chemicals she messes
    with as a way to put more importance on the direct consequence.
